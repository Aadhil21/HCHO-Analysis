# Analyzing Tropospheric Formaldehyde (HCHO) Gas in Sri Lanka

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of tropospheric formaldehyde (HCHO) gas levels in Sri Lanka. Using PySpark for data manipulation, feature extraction, and preprocessing, the project integrates weather data and employs spatiotemporal analysis techniques using Seaborn. A SARIMA model is applied for time-series prediction of HCHO levels, with results communicated through Power BI for insightful visualization.

## Features
- **Data Manipulation and Preprocessing:** Utilizes PySpark for efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Weather Data Integration:** Combines weather data with HCHO levels for comprehensive analysis.
- **Spatiotemporal Analysis:** Uses Seaborn for visualizing trends and patterns over time and space.
- **Time-Series Prediction:** Applies SARIMA model to forecast future HCHO levels.
- **Results Visualization:** Communicates findings through interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Data Processing:** PySpark
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Power BI
- **Time-Series Modeling:** SARIMA
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Power BI

## Assumptions
- Data is available and accurate for the required time period.
- Weather data is consistent and aligns with the HCHO dataset.
- Users have access to Power BI for result visualization.
